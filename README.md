### Slide 2: Hospital Context & Stakeholders

**Clinical Units Impacted:**
- Emergency Department: First point of patient contact for acute presentations
- Cardiology Department: Managing 350+ ECGs daily with limited staff
- Endocrinology Department: Lab result interpretation backlog of 3+ days
- Laboratory Services: Processing thousands of samples with manual result routing

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Decision-makers:** CMO, CIO, Cardiology & Endocrinology Department Heads
- **Users:** ER physicians, cardiologists, endocrinologists, lab technicians, nurses
- **Technical Integration:** IT Department, Data Security Office

**Existing Technology Landscape:**
- Epic EHR system with limited specialty-specific decision support
- GE PACS for imaging storage with no AI augmentation
- Power BI reporting with 24-48 hour lag in insights generation
- Siloed data systems across departments with manual reconciliation

### Slide 3: Problem Definition

**Critical Diagnostic Pain Points:**
- **Cardiology:** 4-hour average ECG interpretation delay during peak hours
- **Endocrinology:** Complex lab pattern interpretation relying on specialist availability
- **Cross-Department:** Fragmented diagnostic processes across specialty boundaries
- **Data Integration:** Manual correlation of multi-specialty findings for complex cases

**Impact Metrics:**
- **KPIs Affected:**
  - Diagnostic turnaround time (currently 240+ minutes for urgent cases)
  - Error rates (12% for complex endocrine disorders, 8% for cardiac arrhythmias)
  - Readmission rates (23% higher for delayed diagnoses)
  - Length of stay (extended by 1.8 days due to diagnostic delays)

**Real-World Consequences:**
- **Case Study:** Patient with diabetic ketoacidosis and cardiac complications experienced 6-hour diagnostic delay, resulting in ICU admission and 40% higher treatment costs
- **Resource Impact:** 1,200+ physician hours monthly spent on routine diagnostic tasks that could be automated
